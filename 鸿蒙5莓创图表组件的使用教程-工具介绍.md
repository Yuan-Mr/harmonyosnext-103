Hello developers, today I finally have the time to share our self-developed chart components with you. I am Chen Yang, the architect of Meichuang Technology. In this course, I will systematically explain the knowledge points of the entire chart component. Those who want to learn can continue to pay attention to my teaching videos. The Meichuang chart component is a high-efficiency visualization tool deeply adapted to HarmonyOS 5.0 (ArkTS framework). Our component takes "low threshold, high performance" as the core design, and the development experience is comparable to Echarts.

I wonder if you have used Echarts, but for many newcomers, they certainly don't know, let alone the attributes in the chart component. This time, follow me to deeply interpret the role and effect of each attribute in the chart component, and help you understand how to use the chart component efficiently in projects through practical cases.

Whether you are a new technical person or a senior expert, I hope you can improve the chart development efficiency by more than 50% through this course and jointly promote the construction of the HarmonyOS ecosystem!

Meichuang Chart has an independent official document for everyone to use more conveniently. Please remember: <http://meichuangit.net.cn/McLineChart>. We will also explain the structure of the entire document and how to use it in the future.


### Introduction to Development Tools

#### What is DevEco Studio?

DevEco Studio is an official integrated development tool (IDEA) developed by Huawei for its HarmonyOS, designed specifically for building HarmonyOS-based applications. It integrates functions such as code editing, debugging, building, and publishing, supporting developers to efficiently develop, test, and release HarmonyOS applications.

#### Main Functional Features: Provide AI-assisted programming, compilation and building, UI real-time preview, code debugging, performance tuning, simulator, etc., to help you efficiently develop HarmonyOS applications and meta-services.

#### Installation Steps

1. Download the installation package:

o Visit the Huawei Developer Official Website (<https://developer.huawei.com/consumer/cn/deveco-studio/>).

o Find DevEco Studio on this page and select the appropriate version to download.

2. Install DevEco Studio:

o Open the downloaded installation package and complete the installation as prompted. You can select the installation path and other options during the installation process.

3. Configure the development environment:

o After installation, start DevEco Studio and enter the configuration interface.

o Configure the development environment as prompted, just click NEXT throughout.

4. Verify the installation:

o Create a new project, run the HelloWorld example, and ensure that the development environment works normally.

For detailed instructions, please check the video tutorial.

#### Component Installation Method

In DevEco Studio, developers can install and manage components through the following methods:

1. Use ohpm install in the terminal to install or upgrade components:

o Open the terminal (DevEco Studio built-in terminal or system terminal).

o Run the following command in the terminal to install the required components:

```
ohpm install <component name>
```

o For example, to install the McCharts (Meichuang Chart) component, you can run:

```
ohpm install @mcui/mccharts
```

o After installation, the component will be automatically added to the project, and developers can use it directly in the code.

o The above installs the latest version. To install a specific version, run:

```
ohpm install @mcui/mccharts@2.8.5
```


### Basic Usage Steps

The purpose of Meichuang Chart is to be convenient to introduce, use, and update.

1. Import the component:

```
import { McLineChart, Options } from '@mcui/mccharts'
```

2. Initialize the configuration:

```typescript
@State options: Options = new Options({
  xAxis: {
    data: ['Monday', 'Tuesday', 'Wednesday']
  },
  series: [{
    name: 'Sample Data',
    data: [10, 20, 30]
  }]
})

build() {
  Row() {
    McLineChart({
      options: this.options
    })
  }
  .height('50%')
}
```

3. Dynamic update:

Partial data update:
```
this.options.setVal({ series: [{ data: [50, 60, 70] }] })
```


### Supported Chart Types

● Line Chart (McLineChart)

● Bar Chart (McBarChart)

● Line-Bar Combined Chart (McLineBarChart)

● Horizontal Bar Chart (McHorBarChart)

● Pie Chart (McPieChart)

● Radar Chart (McRadarChart)

● Gauge Chart (McGaugeChart)

We will explain the detailed attributes of each chart type in the future, so that you can know more.


#### Summary

As the core development tool for HarmonyOS, DevEco Studio provides developers with powerful functional support and convenient operation experience. Through flexible component installation methods, developers can quickly configure the development environment according to project requirements and efficiently complete the development of HarmonyOS applications.

In this course, we will combine the actual operation of DevEco Studio to deeply explain the usage of McCharts (Meichuang Chart) components, helping you master the various functions and application scenarios of the chart components. Let's start this learning journey together!
